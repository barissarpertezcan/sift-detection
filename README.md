# Sift-detection | Simple object detection algorithm made with SIFT/OpenCV in Python
In order to match raw image, which is captured by a real time camera, with one of the logos in the images folder I used an algorithm called SIFT in opencv library.

# Advantages of SIFT Algorithm
It is easy to use and low computation requirement makes this algorithm advantageous in simple systems.

# Advantages of SIFT Algorithm
Feature extraction operation is not done properly on object without clear edges/corners.
